Thrift Core

This repository provides low level components like zigzag encoding,
encoding and decoding of variable length integers,
encoding and decoding headings,
common and simple headers for layered transports.

Currently it only supports the revised [compact protocol](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/doc/specs/thrift-compact-protocol.md) but others may be possible.

# Usage

# Restrictions
 - This repository provides only primitives for encoding and decoding.
   Code generators to deal with the boilerplate are out of scope.

# Todo
 - Original, non-compact format?
